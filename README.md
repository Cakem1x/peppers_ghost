# Pepper's Ghost for WHY2025 Badge With Cone
I am trying to get a setup running that allows you to use the [WHY2025 Badge](https://wiki.why2025.org/Badge) as a [Pepper's Ghost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper%27s_ghost) display.

Inspired by [Roxanne Luo's Pepper's Cone](https://roxanneluo.github.io/PeppersCone.html).
